EZ_Completion
=============

EZ Completion assumes GitHub as a huge knowledge database and suggests auto-completion when similar code exists on GitHub. rogrammers can focus on an implementation for unique and original functions. EZ Completion watches function definition written by the programmer, and search the code via GitHub for implemented similar functions.
